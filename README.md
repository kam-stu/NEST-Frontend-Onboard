# NEST Frontend Onboarding

Welcome to the NEST Frontend Onboarding repository! This guide is designed to help **CSEC members** who are interested in contributing to the **NEST** project get familiar with the technologies and tools used in the project. By the end of this onboarding, you'll have a solid understanding of frontend development and how it interacts with the backend, database, and other components.

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **GitHub**: For collaboration on larger projects.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: The primary programming languages used in NEST.
- **Angular**: The frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Python**: Used for the middleware of the website.
- **Rust**: Used for backend development.
- **Docker**: For containerization and deployment.

## **Getting Started**

### **1. Install Node.js**
To work with JavaScript/TypeScript and Angular, you'll need Node.js installed on your machine.

1. Download and install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en).
2. Verify the installation by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   node -v
   ```

## **Installing TypeScript**

TypeScript is the primary language used in NEST. Follow these steps to install and understand its usage:

1. **Install TypeScript**:
   After installing Node.js, open your terminal and run the following command to install TypeScript globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g typescript
   ```

   Verify installing by running:
   ```bash
   tsc -v
   ```

## **Learning Javascript/Typescript:**
[https://playcode.io/new](https://playcode.io/new) is a wbesite that has Javascript and Typescript where you can run the code directly through browser without downloading Node.JS or using a code editor

Alternatively, just use VS code or whatever your normal code editor is.

## **Learning Angular**
Angular's website: [https://angular.dev](https://angular.dev) has all documentation on there.

I suggest reading the documentation then going along the tutorial that their website also has - or some healthy mix of both.

## **Creating a project in Angular:**
1) Install angular: 
```c
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
2) Verify it's installed: 
```c
ng version
```
3) Create new app: 
```c
ng new your_project_name
```

4) Start development server so you can see changes in real time: 
```c
ng serve
```
*This will give you a localhost website you can access from any browser*
